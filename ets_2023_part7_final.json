Tillford Exalt will also publish calendars and greeting cards that complement the main products.\n\nAlready contracted to write memoirs are award-winning actress Alexia Leoz, London-based conductor and composer Seung-Hyun Bae, and celebrity cook Lain Lai. Ms. Lai's story of her life and career will be the first to be launched. It is set for release in December.\n\nFrederick Bissett, Tillford vice president, said the company saw a need for books that celebrated accomplishments and life events from multiple perspectives. \"We think we're off to a great start,\" he said. He noted that Tillford Exalt's authors were not always famous; the books will be exploring their beginnings, their everyday lives, their first jobs, their marriages and families\u2014as well as their achievements.\n\nTillford Press is based in Manchester, with offices in New York, Toronto, and Sydney; but its publications are sold throughout the world.\n\n"

I wish I could, but it starts at 2:00. I need to be at a different meeting at 2:30.\n\nDaniel Seidal (11:36 A.M): I'm also supposed to go to the 2:30 meeting. Is it essential that one of us attend the marketing meeting?\n\nElla Glatt (11:37 A.M): Well, it would be helpful to have someone from the finance department there, at least for 15 minutes or so.\n\nBill Iverman (11:38 A.M): The quarterly reports just came in, and Daniel, Stef, and I need to review them by the end of the day.\n\nElla Glatt (11:39 A.M): You all have plenty to do.\n\nDaniel Seidal (11:41 A.M): That\u2019s true!

I have a degree in business administration and am attaching my resume as I think I am an excellent fit for your needs. Furthermore, my organizational skills enable me to coordinate multiple activities simultaneously, and I can convey expectations clearly to team members involved in each phase of a project.\n\nMy current role as project coordinator for an international engineering firm, where I have worked for the past five years, has also afforded me ample experience managing teams, schedules, and budgets. While I enjoy the kind of work I do, it has become clear to me that I need motivation from a strong mission. The goal of your company to create sustainable housing projects is something that I strongly support and would be delighted to work on.\n\nThrough my work and volunteer activities, I have spent many months abroad in various countries throughout Asia and the Middle East. This seems particularly relevant to mention, as I am comfortable leading geographically and culturally diverse teams.\n\nThank you for your attention, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.\n\nKind regards,\n\nMaria McFarland\n\n"

The Pro Phone 4 is a game changer in terms of its picture quality and sleek design, said Hill. \"Improvements were based on direct customer feedback; which cited the poor camera functionality as the biggest drawback of prior models. Our clients spoke, and we listened and adapted accordingly.\"\n\nUnlike its predecessor\u2014the Pro Phone 3 at \u00a3999\u2014the Pro Phone 4 includes 512 GB of storage, a 7-inch screen display, and an optional stylus pen, which will hit the shelves on 11 June. One similarity that the Pro Phone 4 has with previous models is the charger: Gorman is instead focusing on wireless convenience.\n\nThe starting price is \u00a3100 more than that of the previous model. Add-ons, such as the stylus pen, protective case, and wireless headphones, will cost an additional \u00a339, \u00a359, and \u00a379, respectively. Product Manager Ian Hill doesn't believe the price increase will dissuade customers.\n\n\u201cWe want to afford our customers the ability to reuse elements of the other Gorman devices they\u2019ve already purchased,\u201d said Hill. \u201cWhy add to the overload of cables already in circulation?\u201d\n\n"

I really don't want to use a password, and I certainly don't want to change it every month. I don't need a high degree of security because my work is not confidential. If someone else gained access to my messages, it wouldn't do much harm.\n\nTo: Gina Xi\n\nFrom: Sam Arnold\n\nDate: Thursday, 10 April\n\nSubject: Tech support request 7549\n\nHello, Ms. Xi,\n\nThis is in reference to your work order 7549 related to the new phone system: to help you with your voice-mail settings, but the new system does require you to have a happy understanding that you do not feel that a high degree of security is needed for employees who do not work with confidential material.\n\nHowever, company policy allows me to change the security settings so that you do not have to reset the password on a regular basis. Anyone who gains access to your voice-mail account can do more than simply listen to your messages: They would be able to delete messages, change your greeting, or change your password so that you would lose access to your own voice mail (at least until someone here at IT could override the password change).\n\nIf you still feel comfortable with that level of risk, let me know, and I will change the settings so that your password never expires.\n\nSam Arnold\n\nTech Support Associate\n\n"

In past versions of the game, getting the reflections and lighting in green and blue areas correct has been a particular challenge, and it was a problem that kept arising. As the new release, Neptune\u2019s Voyage, is primarily an underwater adventure, addressing this problem is crucial. You said you would take charge of this, and I hope to hear that you have found a solution to the problem. The team was hoping to have one last rendering of the lighting for the game by October 10 for a preliminary run-through. Will the final version of the lighting be ready by then? All other aspects of the game are on schedule. Please send me an update about the lighting at your earliest convenience.\n\nRegards,\n\nCliff Merson\n\nProject Manager, Rimerko Games\n\n# Review of Titan Adventure: Neptune's Voyage\n\nBy Leo Weber; April 1\n\nThis new installment of Titan Adventure will surprise and delight both new players and old aficionados long familiar with the series. Though open-world formats have been widespread in recent years, Neptune's Voyage brings something new to the way: By stripping down instructional guides, the game gives users the opportunity to discover new areas and devices.\n\nIn Neptune's Voyage, you wake up as Thetis, a dolphin that is tasked with rescuing Neptune from an underwater cave. Users then climb, run, ride, sail, and fly through the world of the game, encountering new towns, ruins, and other creatures along the way. Some of these creatures will be familiar to longtime fans, but there is plenty of novelty as well: This newest version of Titan Adventure also corrects the green and blue image rendering that was sometimes a problem in earlier installments of Titan Adventure.\n\nNeptune's Voyage launches on May 5 on Rimerko Clutch and FS5. It is available in English, Korean, Japanese, French, and Spanish.\n\n"

I would like to pick them up in person as soon as possible. Do you have any appointments available this week?\n\nI have a question about the fee: Apparently, I am being charged $300 for my documents. I do not understand why the fee is so high, and there was no explanation included in your e-mail.\n\nI have requested records several times in the past in my role with RJ Environmental Engineering and have never paid such a high fee. In this case, I am only requesting two maps of the city\u2019s underground pipelines, which will inform our firm\u2019s work advising the city on wastewater management.\n\nPlease clarify the fee for me, and let me know if I can pick up my documents this week. Thank you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nKeith Brandenberg\n\n# City of Abilene Administrative Building\n\nVisitors must sign in prior to entering this facility:\n\nPlease enter your name and the room you will visit in the logbook\n\n# First-Floor Directory:\n\n|IT Services|Room 100|\n|---|---|\n|Parks and Recreation|Room 101|\n|Transportation|Room 102|\n|Wastewater|Room 103|\n\nPlease enter your name and the room you will visit in the logbook.\n\n"

It provides wonderful insight into his career; starting with his first roles in cinema in his native Sweden, moving into his work in France and Italy, and finishing with his recent theatre work in the U.K.\n\nIn his book, Mr. Eklund dedicates a fair amount of text to discussing his mentor, Charles Gunnarsson, who helped him develop his skills early on. He also describes the difficulty of transitioning into different types of roles; especially from comedic to dramatic acting. He includes several funny anecdotes about his first attempts at acting onstage here in London. He describes them as disastrous, but anyone who saw his recent performance in Life and Games would say just the opposite.\n\nMr. Eklund has long been a captivating actor on stage and screen; and now he is a thoroughly engaging author.\n\n\u2014Uma Joshi\n\nTo: Edith Hocking\n\nFrom: Uma Joshi\n\nDate: 2 March\n\nSubject: RE: Opportunity\n\nDear Edith,\n\nThank you for agreeing to arrange an interview with Mr. Eklund for me. I think this will be a great follow-up to my recent piece.\n\nIn a helpful coincidence, I will be visiting his home country next month to address the benefits of diversity in journalism. I am the featured speaker at the journalists' convention. I\u2019m sure we can set up something with Mr. Eklund just before or after my speech.\n\nBest,\n\nUma Joshi\n\nArts and Culture Editor\n\nTop News U.K.\n\nE-mail\n\nTo: Uma Joshi &lt;ujoshi@topnews.co.uk&gt;\n\nFrom: Maria Cazalla &lt;mcazalla@zephyrmail.se&gt;\n\nDate: 20 March\n\nSubject: RE: Information\n\nDear Ms. Joshi,\n\nWe are all very excited about your interview next month with Mr. Eklund. He enjoys all your writing for Top News U.K.\u2014the news stories, interviews, and, of course, your recent article about The Theatre Lights Dimmed!\n\nI just wanted to finalize a few details with you. We have arranged transportation for you from your hotel to Mr. Eklund\u2019s house and then back to the hotel. Please let me know how many people there will be in your group, because Mr. Eklund would like you all to stay for lunch.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaria Cazalla\n\n"

It has subsequently been a general store, a boutique, and a family-run restaurant used for private parties, such as birthdays and weddings.\n\nFacing potential demolition in the late 1970s, the building was purchased by its current owners, Henry and Juana Thomason, in 1981. Subsequent investment and extensive renovation helped save the H. G. Walsh Building, and in 1996 it gained status on the National Register of Historic Places. With its stunning views of the Columbia River and an extensive seasonal menu, the H. G. Walsh Building has become a prime destination for visitors to Oregon's Pacific coast.\n\n# Fall Menu\n\n|Seafood chowder|Cup: $5|Bowl: $8|\n|---|---|---|\n|Bok choy|$12|$12|\n|Fish and chips|Cod: $12|Halibut: $15|\n|Chef's salad|$11|$11|\n|Grilled salmon|$20|$20|\n\nNotes:\n\n- Cream-based with clams, shrimp, and mussels.\n- Pan-seared in a garlic-ginger oyster sauce and served over rice noodles.\n- Three pieces breaded in a buttermilk batter.\n- Mixed greens tossed with toasted almonds, blue cheese dressing, and avocado.\n- Served with lemon-garlic sauce and a side salad.\n\n"

The In-Store Project, launched on February 7, is a new initiative from the Hannen Department Store corporate operations team. Following recommendations from employees at various levels, the initiative was developed to allow company headquarters to better understand the day-to-day operations at the individual store level.\n\nThe In-Store Project places employees from the corporate headquarters in stores, where they are paired with store employees to work typical shifts. This allows both types of Hannen employees to ask questions and learn about one another's work. So far, the initiative has led to a greater understanding among store employees of the decisions made at the corporate level and a greater understanding among headquarters employees on how corporate plans are implemented.\n\nHannen plans to complete store visits within the next two months and conduct repeat visits annually.\n\n"

Respondents included both local residents and tourists. In one key result, more than 80 percent of all respondents agreed that there should be more emphasis on promoting eco-friendly tourism. In another finding, more than 75 percent of surveyed tourists indicated they would like to see a wider selection of organic food options.\n\nThe insights from the survey are welcome news for Kathy Li, who operates the KLP Organic Farm. Its grocery store, located on the farm property, is stocked year-round with fresh, seasonal, organically grown produce. In the future, if tourist visits increase, Ms. Li plans to offer prepared foods and beverages.\n\n"

She will also continue to serve on the planning committee for the annual art show at Central Arts University, where she learned her jewelry-making techniques.\n\n# Shadeside Plaza\n\nTamara Banda, a lifelong Birch City resident, has set up a brick-and-mortar store in the city\u2019s Shadeside Plaza shopping area. The shop, which opened on November 9, features her entire line of handmade jewelry along with a selection of beautiful natural crystals that can become the centerpiece of any room.\n\nMs. Banda emphasizes that she sets her jewelry brand apart from others by offering handmade designs at price points that won\u2019t break a budget. To keep her overhead costs in check, she says she sources materials creatively from a variety of local metal suppliers.\n\nAlthough managing the store, which is now open, she said, benefits from the heavy foot traffic nearby.\n\n"

However, after much consideration, I have decided that now is not the best time to leave Wilson Law. I am invested in working on my projects here until I did not realize how deeply I was faced with the possibility of leaving the company. While I was thrilled by the idea of working for an illustrious law firm that has won so many high-profile environmental cases, now is not the time for me to make a change.\n\nIt was a pleasure meeting you and your colleagues, and I hope we cross paths in the future.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJonas Ivanov\n\n"

        "Content": "# MEMO\n\nTo: Kildare Recreation Centre Staff\n\nFrom: Madeline Byrne\n\nDate: 11 April\n\nSubject: Daily Passes\n\nAs discussed in April's staff meeting, we are considering raising the cost of daily passes from \u20ac5 to \u20ac9. The exact increase will be decided in our May meeting. This change is expected to bring in an extra \u20ac5,000 over the next year, which we will use toward the cost of replacing our outdoor running track. With the increased revenue from the fee change, we will be close to the \u20ac7,000 needed for the improvement.\n\nI realize that the outdoor running season is short, and I know that in our meeting, some staff members wanted to consider other uses for the money. The possibilities of using the funds for a remodeled reception area, a new floor for the dance studio, or more flat-screen televisions throughout the centre were raised. However, the board of directors thought it would be wiser to focus on the improvement most frequently requested by our members. The upgrades suggested by the staff fall into the \u20ac1,000-\u20ac2,000 range, and we hope to be able to consider them in the coming years.\n\n# NOTICE\n\n# Kildare Recreation Centre Visitors\n\nEffective June, the cost of a daily pass for nonmembers will be \u20ac8. This modest increase will allow us to provide visitors with a much better outdoor running track. The cost of monthly and annual memberships has not changed. Please visit the registration office during regular business hours to discuss membership-related issues.\n\n"

        "Content": "# Carina Solutions\n\n# The Best Software Option for Hotel Management\n\nWe will help you manage all aspects of your hotel. Whether you need help with your reservation system, managing staff, or improving your advertising and online presence, our software will work for you!\n\n# Here are just a few of the tasks our software can do:\n\n- Manage online bookings and payments\n- Track staff hours and vacation time\n- Promote your hotel on top booking websites\n- Manage property maintenance\n\nContact us today to begin using the trial version of our software completely free for three months. More information about the pricing and features of the Premier software version can be found on the Services page of our website.\n\n# Reviews\n\nI have to decide whether to purchase the Premier version or search for something better:\n\nMy trial version of the Carina Solutions hotel management software expires tomorrow, and I have two main concerns:\n\n1. The reservations module does not allow you to keep information about repeat guests on file. This forces staff to reenter repeat customers' information manually, which wastes time.\n2. The software offers full functionality only when accessed on a desktop computer; which is unfortunate because I do almost everything on my mobile phone. The interface should be the same no matter what device you use.\n\n\u2014Submitted by Susan Yan\n\nDear Ms. Yan,\n\nGood news! We have updated some features of Carina Solutions since you began your trial subscription: There is now an automatic rebooking feature that you can use to register repeat guests, cutting down on manual data entry.\n\nAdditionally, you should know that one of the differences between the trial version and the Premier version is that the interfaces are the same across all devices.\n\nRemember, Carina Solutions hotel management software is more than just a booking tool. Learning about all the features in the Premier version can help you fill your hotel with happy customers. Make sure to visit carinasolutions.com to see our instructional videos.\n\nMarcus Feldman\n\nCarina Solutions representative\n\n"

On rare occasions, ground delays occur. In these cases, if the delay lasts more than 60 minutes (for domestic flights) or three hours (for international flights), the aircraft will return to the gate, and passengers can get off the plane. Passengers will receive notifications at the gate every 30 minutes regarding the status of the delay. These notifications will include the reasons for the delay and whether further amenities will be available such as meal or hotel vouchers.\n\nIf the delay continues for more than two hours, we will provide complimentary snacks and beverages.\n\n"

The initial launch includes three flavors: peppermint, lemon ginger, and hibiscus flower. More varieties are expected to be added next year.\n\nNext, Miguel Luna shared his prototypes of the tea boxes and discussed the sustainability of the materials used to produce them. The colorful designs received positive feedback from meeting attendees.\n\nAfter that, Jennifer Lin provided a brief overview of the marketing budget for the product launch. Funds are currently limited to one advertising campaign. For more detailed information about the marketing budget, contact Ms. Lin directly.\n\nFinally, Vladimir Ikram led a discussion about advertising options. Radio advertisements have been successful in the past and are cheaper than television. Digital advertisements were also considered. The final decision was to start with print advertisements in The Southtown Times.\n\nThe next meeting will be on August 17.\n\n"

Why?\n\nJoanne Matos (11:59 A.M):\n\nI'm setting up for this afternoon's party under the tent out in the cafe courtyard, and want to have seating information posted for people as they arrive.\n\nJim likely has it: He usually sets things up for that big signboard - the one that we usually post at the entrance to advertise when we\u2019re having those sales. But I think he's gone for the day.\n\nJim Thomas (12:02 P.M):\n\nNo, I'm not! I'm out making a delivery right now, but I'll be back soon. You can find the signboard in the alcove just inside our building's delivery entrance. Just put it back when you're done so that I can find it the next time I need it.\n\nTuyet Nguyen (12:03 P.M):\n\nNo problem. Thanks!\n\nJoanne Matos (12:04 P.M):\n\nNo problem. Thanks!\n\n"

See photos of animals and landscapes from the researcher's personal collection, taken during his forty-year career.\n\n# Humans in Art\n\nJanuary 1-29\n\nThis collection of paintings and sculptures from dozens of artists, past and present, shows us the many ways artists can depict a human subject. Works from both famous and relatively unknown artists are included here.\n\n# Everyday Art\n\nFebruary 1-26\n\nA variety of handmade items are on display in this exhibit showing art in everyday life: From handmade quilts to furniture, see these household items in a whole new way.\n\n# Review of Central Art Museum\n\nReviewer: Mary Walsh\n\nStars: Review ****\n\nI recommend the Central Art Museum to anyone interested in not only art but history as well: I've made two trips to the museum recently. My first trip was with my school's photography club. We only saw the special exhibit featuring photography; but left wanting to see the rest of the museum. I returned a few days later and had the chance to walk through the entire museum. Each exhibit was different but full of interesting pieces.\n\nBe sure to stop at the interactive room near the gift shop for a hands-on experience. During my first trip, the room had cameras with fun backgrounds. Visitors took pictures of themselves, and for a small fee, I got a printout of myself as if I were holding a flag on the moon! Like the special exhibits, the activities at the interactive room change every month, so you will always find something new and interesting to do.\n\n"

From July 8 to July 25, participating restaurants in the Alexandria area will offer set menus at discounted prices. As in past years, restaurants can offer a two-course lunch menu for $15, a two-course dinner menu for $20, or a three-course dinner menu for $30. Both customers and restaurant owners love the showcase. Food enthusiasts try new options at a lower cost, and restaurants report it\u2019s the time of year when dining areas are at their fullest.\n\nAlexandria had its first restaurant showcase 15 years ago. It was modeled on a similar showcase in the beach town of Willmar. Originally, only eight restaurants participated. Since then, the showcase has grown, adding more restaurants and extending the number of days each year. This year, there will be 40 participating restaurants\u2014about 70 percent of all the restaurants in Alexandria. Those looking to book a table should act fast: Some restaurants require reservations, and the most popular places book up quickly. To see the list of participating restaurants and make a reservation, visit www.alexandriarestaurants.com/showcase.\n\n# Showing search results for: Center City Neighborhood\n\n# Claire's\n\nFrench food\n\nServing lunch and 3-course dinner\n\nOpen Tuesday-Sunday\n\nCall (703) 555-0102 to make a reservation:\n\n# Fresh Fish Grill\n\nSeafood\n\nServing lunch and 3-course dinner\n\nOpen Monday-Sunday\n\nCall (703) 555-0195 to make a reservation:\n\n# Jin-Yi's House\n\nKorean food\n\nServing 2-course dinner\n\nOpen Wednesday-Saturday\n\nCall (703) 555-0198 to make a reservation:\n\n# Roberto's Pizzeria\n\nItalian food\n\nServing lunch only\n\nOpen Tuesday-Sunday\n\nNo reservations necessary\n\n# Fresh Fish Grill Review\n\nNori Sato | https://www-foodreviews.com/alexandria/freshfishgrill\n\nNot only was the food excellent, but the staff was welcoming and efficient.

Many Ferd Data Services employees use their personal mobile phones for business calls. To get reimbursed, they must submit a form every month. Ferd then pays up to 30 percent of the phone bill. My department confirms each employee's calculations and then schedules payments that vary every month.\n\nSome companies have moved to a flat-rate model, whereby all employees who qualify receive a fixed amount each month (e.g., $20). No staff time is required for monthly processing; the allowance is automatically included in each paycheck.\n\nI hope that, as head of Human Resources, you will consider adopting a policy like this.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMonica Cheung\n\n# Ferd Data Services\n\n# MEETING AGENDA\n\nDate: October 24\n\nLocation: Online\n\nTime: 3:00 PM\n\nHost: Celeste O'Brien, Vice President, Human Resources\n\nAttendees: Human Resources Managers; Finance Managers; Department Heads\n\n# OBJECTIVES:\n\n1. Consider issues with the current mobile phone reimbursement program\n2. Review other options along with advantages and disadvantages\n3. Select a new reimbursement model, if appropriate\n\n# OPTIONS:\n\n1. Continue to reimburse employees for up to 30 percent of their business mobile phone use\n2. Provide a flat monthly amount to employees who qualify; employees with high costs can submit requests for additional compensation\n3. Provide qualified employees with mobile phones for business use\n\n# Ferd Data Services Employee Policies\n\n# Mobile Phone Reimbursement Policy\n\nRevised October 30\n\nEmployees who work remotely and/or travel for business purposes should be reimbursed for business use of mobile phones. Three options are available:\n\nEmployees who qualify will receive a mobile phone allowance of $20 per month, regardless of actual expenses. To enroll in the program, employees must submit a Mobile Phone Allowance form with their supervisor's signature. The $20 allowance will be applied to each month's paycheck.Employees with large charges may submit actual expenses to receive additional reimbursement.Managers and executives may opt for a company mobile phone, which is for business use only.\n\n"

Patients will then be able to register to access their records, get lab results, and book appointments.\n\nWe had also planned to launch a payment option within the portal. However, the web developers are still dealing with issues with the billing system. As a result, that part of the system will be implemented at a later time.\n\nIt will take some time for all of us to learn how to work with the portal.

We can wash our hands at the Carlton Apartments after we finish this job.\n\nJim Szymanski (9:44 A.M): Right. We'll be doing the same thing this morning as we did last time. We'll enter each apartment unit and vacuum out the filter in the wall air conditioner. Any filter that looks too dusty should be replaced. Also, we should clear out debris from the vents.\n\nBev Munoz (9:46 A.M): Got it. Will all the apartments be unoccupied?\n\nJim Szymanski (9:47 A.M): The students are on school holiday. But you may want to knock on the doors just in case.\n\nBev Munoz (9:48 A.M): OK. I can handle Building A because I\u2019m parked nearby. You could work on Building B. The work will go more quickly that way, and we'll have time for an afternoon lunch break.\n\nJim Szymanski (9:49 A.M): Exactly. Let me know if you need anything else this morning.\n\n"

That is why we are introducing contactless technology for all our member credit and debit cards. With this new development, you will no longer have to swipe or insert your card in a chip reader at checkout. In fact, you will not even need to remove your card from a physical wallet; simply hold it near a point of sale for it to be read!\n\n# There are a few important things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Your current card will be deactivated on October 31. You may continue to use it until that time.\n2. The upgraded card may arrive before your current one expires. Once you activate the new card, the old one will automatically be deactivated and no longer be valid for use. You will need to manually activate your new card by following the instructions on the attached sticker.\n3. Your contactless technology card will have a new card number, expiration date, and security number. When activating, you will be prompted to choose a PIN (personal identification number). The PIN from your current card will not automatically transfer over. Be sure to update your card on file for all preferred online retailers and app subscriptions to ensure continued access.\n\nWe hope that you enjoy your new card. For any questions regarding your contactless technology Impala card, feel free to contact customer service at 1-610-555-0168.\n\n"

Would you both feel comfortable giving the presentation about the new Riverwalk to the urban development committee on Friday?\n\nCassie Alswith (9:18 A.M): I think we could handle that. Right, Austin?\n\nAustin Everett (9:20 A.M): Definitely. I'm not sure how available you will be, Ms. Jung, but we could send you an overview of the presentation on Thursday if you'd like.\n\nFrieda Jung (9:22 A.M): I don't think that's necessary. Please be sure to highlight the revenue that we think will be brought into the region by the new businesses, as well as the positive environmental impacts our research group noted.\n\nAustin Everett (9:23 A.M): Got it. We will make sure to do that.\n\nCassie Alswith (9:25 A.M): Would it be okay if I submit the weekly progress report on Monday instead of Friday? That way I'll have a little more time to prepare for the presentation.\n\nFrieda Jung (9:26 A.M): Yes, that's a good idea.\n\nCassie Alswith (9:26 A.M): Great. Thank you!\n\nFrieda Jung (9:27 A.M): I might not respond to e-mail as frequently while I'm gone, but feel free to call me or text me if there's anything urgent that comes up.\n\n"

I have over fifteen years of experience working in personal finance and have worked at Westmouth Financial for three of those years, helping over 25 clients meet their retirement goals through savvy financial planning. I am excited to help you continue this journey.\n\nSecondly, I would like to schedule a time to meet or talk with you about your current portfolio. It would be good for us to touch base to plan your investment strategy for the next ten years as you are nearing your retirement. I wanted to see if you were interested in shifting some of your funds into more stable assets like bonds and annuities.\n\nPlease feel free to call me or send an e-mail so we can arrange a time to talk. Thanks, and I look forward to speaking more.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRita Hidayat\n\nAccount Manager\n\n"

That building is now the home of the Cornata Theatre Company.\n\nThe grand-opening ceremony was held on Tuesday, and tours of the theatre were given to attendees. The debut show is Relax, a comedy by Mi-Sun Yeo, that is scheduled to begin on Saturday, 16 July, and run until the end of the month.\n\nAccording to Noah Larkins, the artistic director of the Cornata Theatre Company, the theatre houses a main stage theatre that seats approximately 325 people and a smaller studio theatre upstairs. The company will also offer acting classes for children and adults.\n\nFor more information or to buy tickets, visit the company\u2019s Web page at www.cornatatheatre.nz.\n\n\u201cWe want to be part of the artistic communities in both Auckland and the larger community around us,\u201d said Mr. Larkins.\n\n\u201cTalk-backs\u201d will immediately follow every performance. Talk-backs allow the director and cast members to share their thoughts about the play; and audience members can ask them questions.\n\n# Thank you for attending Relax.\n\nPlease take a few moments to tell us about your experience:\n\n# 1. How would you rate the performance you saw?\n\nExcellent\nGood\nFair\nDid not enjoy\n\n# 2. How would you rate your overall theatre experience?\n\nExcellent\nGood\nFair\nDid not enjoy\n\n# 3. How did you hear about us? (Check all that apply):\n\nPrint advertisement\nSocial media\nTelevision\nE-mail\n\n# Comments:\n\nThe play was a fascinating story, and the acting was brilliant. I'm delighted to be a subscribing member of the theatre this season. If all the shows are this good, I'll be very happy. There did seem to be a problem with the concession stand. There was a long line for food and drinks, and it did not move very quickly.\n\n"

We appreciate that you were able to spend so much time with us discussing your background and plans for the future. We are pleased to offer you the position of Director of Commercial Lending. The position will be based in our George Town location on the Cayman Islands.\n\nShould you accept the position, you will receive the pay and benefits described during the interview process, as well as a relocation reimbursement of USD $1,000.\n\nPlease let us know whether you accept the offer by 29 November and inform us of your preferred start date. We hope to have the position filled by mid-December.\n\nCongratulations on being selected. We look forward to welcoming you to our team.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRozella Huy\n\nPresident, Ventana Bank\n\nE-mail\n\nTo: Tomas Melville &lt;tmelville@homenetwork.bb&gt;\n\nFrom: Quentin Rines &lt;qrines@islandlink.bbz&gt;\n\nDate: 14 November\n\nSubject: New position\n\nMr. Melville,\n\nI just received the job offer from Ventana Bank that we discussed on Monday. They are meeting my salary request and offering me money for relocating too.\n\nThis has been my goal ever since you hired me as a teller, right out of college. But now that I have been offered my dream job, I am having doubts. The new location seems so far away. I would rarely get to see my parents and my siblings.\n\nI would welcome your help in this matter. Could we get together in the next few days for lunch or coffee? As you know, I have always valued your input, and I have missed our lunchtime conversations since you retired.\n\nQuentin\n\n"

It was the best I ever had! I did some research on your products, and I was very impressed with your process. I especially appreciate that your workers take care to remove the shells from the beans by hand.\n\nI would like to purchase some more to make my own chocolates at home. Please send me information and pricing. I would prefer to purchase a one-pound block of pure, unsweetened Yucatan cocoa. I will be sweetening the candy myself, so I am not looking for sweetened cocoa.\n\nThank you.\n\nJames Grigio\n\n# Mayan Joy Cocoa Products Chart\n\n|House Blend|Artisan Block|Mayan Block Gift| | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Half-pound bag $25|1 pound $40|2 pounds $98| | | | |\n|Item: 0-23|Item: C-100|Item: C-200|Item: M-42| | | |\n|Rich, bittersweet; House Pure cocoa Blend|Pure cocoa Artisan Block| |Mountain grown|Block Gift| | |\n|Ready for making steamy; frothy; hot drinks|Half-pound bag $25|Beautifully displayed in a handcrafted wooden gift box|1 pound $40| | | |\n| | |2 pounds $98|Item: D-23|Cocoa, white and brown sugar; cinnamon, ancho, cayenne, allspice, anise, and|Rich, bittersweet, in block form| |\n|100% pure cocoa|in block form|Pure cocoa in block form|Pure cocoa Mountain grown| | | |\n|in the highlands of Yucatan|from the Yucatan|from the Yucatan|in the highlands of Guatemala| | | |\n|Ready for making steamy, frothy, hot drinks|Perfect for drinks, cooking, baking, and confections|Beautifully displayed in a handcrafted wooden gift box|Unsweetened cocoa in bag| | | |\n| |100% pure cocoa|in block form|100% pure cocoa in block form|100% pure cocoa in block form| | |\n\n"

Medallion recommends investing in a chat window for the Web site and training customer representatives to use it. Customers enjoyed the Web site, and the chat feature would allow customers to get immediate service.\n\nOne general comment stood out regarding product options. Customers appreciated the wide variety of low-pile carpets with short fibers. They appreciated their high durability for areas where people frequently walk. However, they were also interested in thicker shag rugs for lounge areas like living rooms.\n\n# Floorsy Discount Coupon\n\nThank you for responding to our customer survey!\n\nAs a reward for your support, get 20% off your next online purchase from May 1 to 31!\n\nEnter the code REWARD20 at checkout:\n\nNote: Floorsy.com offers free shipping and handling on all orders.\n\n# Thank You For Your Order\n\nDear Mr. Lindsay,\n\nThank you for your phone order: The following items from your order #104850 have been delivered:\n\n|Hendesia Low-Pile Rug in Ruby Red (6x9)|x1|$180.00|\n|---|---|---|\n|Verenia Shag Rug in Blue (6x9)|x1|$250.00|\n\n|Subtotal|$430.00|\n|---|---|\n|Discount|$86.00 (Code: REWARD20)|\n|Total|$344.00|\n|Paid|in full|\n\nAs a growing business, we take all reviews and comments seriously.

The Veruvatron 800 is perfect because it is slim and light.\n\nI did quite a bit of research comparing different brands in terms of image resolution and other specifications. Many were comparable in those specifications, but the Veruvatron 800 is especially easy to bring to all my presentations, and that is ultimately why I chose this one.\n\nOne flaw is that both the power cord and the VGA cord are surprisingly short. I have needed to use an extension cord pretty much every time I use it, so be prepared to do the same.\n\n\u2014 Horace Offerman\n\n"

I have some great data to reinforce my points, but I think it will be easier for people to understand if the information is presented visually. Is anybody interested in helping me develop the visual component of my presentation? Some pie charts and diagrams would make a big impact in the slideshow.\n\nThe goal is to present the advantages and disadvantages of the three proposals for using the Holt property in northeast Sunner Valley. I am hoping that the commission accepts Ken Jansen's offer to buy the property, which is next to his land. He would expand his orchard and this would help maintain the rural nature of northern Sunner Valley.\n\nThe speaker sign-up guidelines state that I will need to submit my presentation materials before the agenda gets posted online, but they do not specify when this will happen. I will call today to find out more details.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKathleen Huff\n\n"

The product you ordered, Women\u2019s Stretch Jeans size 36 in midnight blue, is one of our best-selling women\u2019s styles. In order to get the dark blue color that makes these jeans such a standout, the fabric is dyed twice to deepen the color of the denim. It is unfortunate that you did not see these warnings and that your sofa has become discolored as a result.\n\nThe item\u2019s label clearly states that some dye may rub off on light-colored fabric or upholstery until the product has been washed several times. It also suggests washing the jeans with dark colors only, as the dye may run in the wash.\n\nOur goal at Shoppe des Jeans is 100% customer satisfaction with every purchase. This kind of situation, however, is not covered under our customer service guarantee, since the issue with the dye is addressed on the product\u2019s label. I suggest you try treating the sofa with baking soda, followed by upholstery cleaner.\n\nRegards,\n\nBertine Olivier\n\nCustomer Care Representative, Shoppe des Jeans\n\n"

The main components of the production line are running as expected. These components include mixers, rollers, and the textile production system. \u2014 [2] \u2014. The rotating drums for assembling the tires that were added last quarter have also been functioning as expected. Finally, the molds for the tire treads are beginning to show some signs of wear. Employees have flagged these molds, and the molds will be removed from the production line.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nPurchasing new replacement molds is the top priority. See the report in the section dedicated to tire molds for details. \u2014 [3] \u2014. Finally, as the Kiame plant increases its production, adding more mixers will be crucial to making more tires. The company must decide at that point whether to purchase newer mixer models or to upgrade those that we are currently using. \u2014 [4] \u2014. However, replacing the older mixers will speed up production, which will likely outweigh any additional cost.\n\n"

The winner will be featured at an on-site celebration and show guests and journalists around the finished building, explaining its environmental highlights.\n\n# ENTRANTS:\n\nPriority consideration will be given to members of the LNZB, but any professional builder who completes a project in New Zealand before 15 December of this year may apply. Go to the LNZB Web site for the submission form.\n\n# DUE DATE:\n\nAll submissions are due by 15 December.\n\n# JUDGING PROCESS:\n\nThe application and vetting process includes several steps. After screening the candidates, judges will choose semifinalists. Then a special panel will choose this year\u2019s recipient.\n\n# FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nVisit www.leagueofnewzealandbuilders.org.nz to learn more about the LNZB and past winners.\n\n# Rahotu Wins LNZB Prize\n\n(17 March) The League of New Zealand Builders (LNZB) yesterday announced that Maia Rahotu won this year's Sustainability Competition. Ms. Rahotu, whose work on building designs throughout New Zealand goes back many years, won the award for her design of the Rowan Community Centre. The centre utilized renewable and recycled materials throughout its construction. In April, Ms. Rahotu will be formally presented with the award during the ceremony at the centre; details will be announced soon.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough decision this year,\u201d said LNZB\u2019s director, Thomas Young. \u201cAll applicants chose materials that minimize environmental impact. But we were able to narrow the candidates to three top choices, each of whom was interviewed by our panel of experts.\u201d\n\nAccording to experts at LNZB, what is exceptional about Ms. Rahotu\u2019s design is how well it harvests solar energy. Her solar design generates a high surplus of electricity beyond the building\u2019s requirements. This surplus is transmitted to the region\u2019s power grid\u2014in effect reducing strain on local energy production.\n\n"

Be sure to remove the leather hanging strap before cleaning, since water will make the leather tough and brittle.\n\nTo store your product, hang it upright from the leather strap on a wall or shelf. Do not store it in direct sunlight, since this will cause the vibrant colors of the board to fade. Periodically, polish the board with a light coat of olive oil to help the board\u2019s colors stay bright.\n\nLike all Lazon products, our cutting boards are handmade. With minimal upkeep, you can keep your product looking like new.\n\nIf you have any problems with your board, please e-mail us at support@lazonproducts.com. Our policy is to replace at no cost any defective parts or products within three months of purchase. At Lazon Products, quality is our top priority!\n\nFrom: Jonas E. Iversen &lt;jonaseiversen@daylightcommerce.com&gt;\n\nTo: support@lazonproducts.com\n\nDate: August 2, 4:58 PM\n\nSubject: Model #B875\n\nHello,\n\nI\u2019m writing in regard to a defect in my Lazon Model #B875 board. I was very careful to follow all the maintenance tips that came with the product, but when I was taking off the leather strap as instructed, I noticed a small tear had formed in the middle. It\u2019s not very large now, but it will only get bigger after a couple more months of use. Even though I purchased the product four months ago, I only started using it one month ago. Is the leather strap still covered under your defective parts policy? I\u2019d like to get a new one.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nJonas E. Iversen\n\n"

Open year-round, our facilities include a full-service restaurant, a relaxing swimming pool, and a rooftop deck with an amazing view.\n\nButterfly season is from mid-November to early March; and millions of monarch butterflies pass the winter at the Tall Trees sanctuary. Visitors can hike up the mountain on foot; but most prefer to participate in our guided horseback tours. Our expert guides, who escort visitors up the mountain, are all local villagers. They continuously scout the sanctuary for the best viewing locations.\n\nAt all times of the year, we offer hiking trails, bird-watching, and horseback riding. Electric vehicle tours of the villages and farms outside the sanctuary are also available.\n\n# Contact Us\n\nTo: Carmen Sanchez &lt;c.sanchez@flutteringwings.com.mx&gt;\n\nFrom: James Norville &lt;jnorville@itiaworld.org&gt;\n\nDate: June 12\n\nSubject: International Travel Industry Association Guardian Award\n\n# Congratulations, Carmen Sanchez!\n\nFluttering Wings Resort has been named a recipient of an International Travel Industry Association Guardian Award.

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me after for agreeing to the video meeting on 5 January. I\u2019m going to ask my project manager, Ms. Woo-Jin Ko, to join us. Among the questions she has about lighting for my greenhouses, I think she has some questions about the products offered by Brillante Luxlight. I understand you helped design some of their products, so perhaps you can offer some advice. I know we\u2019ll both have many other questions, and I appreciate this opportunity to look in-person. I also hope to visit your greenhouses sometime to get an understanding at your operations.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJacob Brewster\n\nTo: Jacob Brewster &lt;jbrewster@sootenfarms.co.uk&gt;\n\nFrom: Juana Galvez &lt;jgalvez@brillanteluxlight.com.mx&gt;\n\nSubject: Agreement\n\nDate: 30 January\n\nDear Mr. Brewster:\n\nWe received the request and the design specifications from you. Unfortunately, the recent inclement weather has delayed the shipments of some materials we need to begin production. However, once these materials arrive, we will fast-track your order and begin production immediately.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJuana Galvez\n\n"

I live in Dubai but travel to Singapore for work regularly, so it\u2019s great to belong to a gym with locations in both countries!\n\nThe Marina South gym in Singapore is very clean and well designed, but there are two areas that need improvement. There are not enough machines, especially compared to the much larger Orchard Road location. Also, I have visited the gym about ten times and on nearly half of those occasions, the pool was not available for use. I will still use this gym because of the global membership, but I hope they address the cause of the pool closures.\n\nTo: Sam Adawi\n\nFrom: Ani Wayanti\n\nDate: 14 October\n\nSubject: Stokner Service\n\nMr. Adawi,\n\nI have problems we have had a one-year contract with Stokner Service, but I am very concerned. The maintenance at the Orange Light Gyms in Singapore employs workers that are due to improper training. Quite simply, I don\u2019t think the workers that Stokner are trained well enough to do their jobs. Can we meet to discuss this? The sooner we resolve this issue, the better.\n\nMs. Wayanti\n\nRegional Manager\n\nOrange Light Gym\n\n"

Ms. Bautista purchases all the textiles she uses from local craftspeople.\n\nCurrently, Home Style merchandise is available only in select San Jacinto-area stores. Ms. Bautista learned basic weaving techniques from her mother and aunts in her youth and built on that knowledge as she studied at the Manila School of Fashion and Design.\n\nShe then spent the next ten years working as a junior designer for Trendy Today. Finally, she returned to her hometown of San Jacinto to found Home Style.\n\n\u201cI want to keep production local,\u201d said Ms. Bautista. \u201cThat\u2019s good for the artisans, and it\u2019s authentic. But I don\u2019t want the products to remain local. I want to bring our designs to the whole country\u2014maybe even the world.\u201d\n\n"

The exquisite grounds of the estate are situated on 60 hectares of hilly terrain featuring lush English gardens and an impressive manor house that was designed by noted architect Owen Barton.\n\nTen years ago, the Clarrell Foundation decided to transform the estate into an arts centre. Initially, the foundation opened the manor house to the public, highlighting the Clarrell family art collection. In the last three years, a large, multiuse complex was built near the property entrance, complete with art studios and a theatre.\n\nThe Clarrell Estate's museum and gardens are open to the public free of charge. In addition, the theatre hosts public lectures as well as musical performances, and the studios showcase individual artists' curated works. For a complete schedule, a list of current artists, and information on admission fees for the theatre and studios, please visit the Events page.\n\nJoin the Clarrell Foundation to enjoy members-only special events and discounts on performances. Members also have the opportunity to reserve the gardens for private events. To become a member, contact Alicia Ji at aji@clarrellestate.com.au.\n\n"

She was enrolled in the painting class I teach on Tuesday and Thursday. She was only able to attend for the first week because another commitment came up. She said she asked someone in the Tucson Adult School office if she could drop the class, and she has requested a refund of the course tuition.\n\nShe said she hasn't received her refund yet. Did she contact you?\n\nBest,\n\nMarybeth Wright\n\nTo: Marybeth Wright\n\nFrom: Bridget Morandi\n\nDate: March 24\n\nSubject: Re: Refund request\n\nHi Marybeth,\n\nThe name is familiar; but Ms. Reddy hasn't been in touch with me personally. Actually, I'm not the person she should contact: I just handle the supplies for the art classes. I don't know who Ms. Reddy spoke to. According to our refund policy on the Tucson Adult School Web site, refunds are only granted if they are requested before the class begins or if there is a documented health reason for dropping the class. In the case of a health reason, the amount of the refund will be based on the number of classes completed. Maybe Ms. Reddy can attend your second semester class instead of this semester's. That would be my suggestion.\n\nBridget Morandi\n\n"

        "Content": "# New Bakery Coming to Town\n\nOREVALE CITY (October 14)\u2014A Cresson\u2019s Bakery is opening soon at the corner of Canton Avenue and Ridley Street. The location will be the national chain\u2019s first within the city limits. Like all Cresson\u2019s Bakery stores, it will operate seven days a week.\n\nThe only similar business in the vicinity is the Donut Station on the Kupperman University campus. Cresson\u2019s Bakery will offer breakfast sandwiches and fruit juices in addition to its signature coffee and baked goods. The company is following its revised business model to open compact facilities rather than sit-down eateries. This means the Orevale City location will offer takeout and drive-through service only.\n\nApproval for the project followed a public hearing where area residents voiced mixed opinions. Gina Holton, who lives on Paxton Road, said she liked the idea of having a new bakery in her neighborhood but worries about traffic congestion on Ridley Street. As evidence, she presented pictures of heavy vehicle traffic there. Wofford Drive resident Steven Lu said he would enjoy having a convenient place to grab a quick snack.\n\nCresson\u2019s Bakery is slated to welcome its first customers in early March.\n\nDear Editor;\n\nUnfortunately, the October 14 article contained some inaccurate information. As a lifelong resident of Orevale City, I appreciate your coverage of Cresson\u2019s Bakery: the photos that I shared during the public hearing captured images of traffic congestion in front of my house. Also, as a member of the city\u2019s Historic Preservation Committee, I was primarily concerned about the bakery\u2019s architecture. The initial design for Cresson\u2019s Bakery was contemporary: the chain has agreed to modify the exterior so that it blends in better with the older structures surrounding it.\n\nSincerely,\nGina Holton\n\n"

Our new fibre-optic cable lines offer faster and more reliable service and eliminate the need for aboveground wiring. In order for the system to work, we need to install Internet connection devices throughout the city. Phase 1 of our construction work involved City Centre. Phase 2 involved West End. Although Phase 2 took longer than expected, we were able to expedite Phase 3 and get back on schedule. Phase 4 is now ready to begin in your area.\n\nRaxconnect would like to place a small Internet connection hub on your property at 29 Lefroy Street. Because of its central location on the street, your front yard would make an optimal connection point. Please call us at 0141 496 0001 by 10 April to let us know whether we may proceed. Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrandy Mortimer\n\nBrandy Mortimer, Utilities Adviser\n\n# Raxconnect Expands Service\n\nGLASGOW (14 March) \u2014 After unexpected delays in West End, Raxconnect has finally completed the latest phase of its project to install fibre-optic cable throughout the city. Residents and businesses in Southside are now enjoying faster Internet service.\n\nFor the next phase of the project, Raxconnect has identified key locations for connection hubs and is currently reaching out to residents and homeowners so that work can begin as soon as possible. The moves follow an announcement earlier this year that Raxconnect had invested \u00a3350 million to expand its network. Local business officials hope that the project brings new spending and businesses to their neighbourhoods.\n\n# Notice of Temporary Road Closure\n\nPlease be aware that construction at 29 Lefroy Street will result in the closure of the entire street. The closure will last from Monday, 31 May, until Tuesday, 8 June. During that period, automobile access will be limited to residents who live on Lefroy Street.\n\n"

The new products are expected to be in Australian stores by mid-November.\n\nThe company was founded 25 years ago by Albert and Annie Grundon, president and CEO, respectively. Earlier this year, they announced the opening of a South African division. South African retailers will get access to a number of Albert and Annie\u2019s products in mid-December.\n\nTo: Kevin Oessenich &lt;kevin.o@albertandannies.com.au&gt;\n\nFrom: Skye Botha &lt;sbotha@westerncapeeats.co.za&gt;\n\nDate: 3 November\n\nSubject: Interview request\n\nDear Mr. Oessenich,\n\nI am a reporter for Western Cape Eats, a news site for food lovers in the Cape Town area. I would very much like to interview one or both of your company\u2019s founders about your products and to find out which products will be available here in South Africa. My readers are eager to know what to expect. Readers would also like to know if Albert and Annie\u2019s will be promoting itself at this year\u2019s Wooden Sailboat Festival. Most local businesses rent booths there as it is a major event.\n\nThe interview can be conducted by phone or video chat. I look forward to your reply.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSkye Botha\n\n# Reviews\n\nJim Sato, 31 December\n\nYour article informing me about Albert and Annie's, an ice-cream company that just came to South Africa, gave me one more reason to attend the annual Wooden Sailboat Festival. The booth offered three amazing flavours: Coffee Truffle, Fudge Mint; and Chocolate Pretzel Delight. I got to sample some sensational ice creams at Albert and Annie's booth.\n\nIn your article, Mr. Oessenich stated that these would be the first flavours to be rolled out to grocery outlets in South Africa and that more will become available over time. I can't wait!\n\n"

        "Content": "# Ben\u2019s Nonprofit Burst\u2014Resources for those who work in the nonprofit sector\n\n# Getting Grants\n\nPosted on August 18 by Ben Fineman\n\nGrant writing is the art of completing applications for financial aid offered by government agencies, schools, corporations, or other entities. There is huge competition for grants and no room for mediocrity in grant writing. To improve your grant-writing skills, consider taking an online course taught by Kristina Gilliam of Meadow Park University. Her course, Writing Great Grants, is designed for people with some basic knowledge of grant writing. These interactive classes run Monday evenings from November 15 to December 6.\n\nFor details and registration, visit www.kristinagilliam.ca/course. Use promo code NPBURST at checkout to get 10 percent off the $350 tuition. This offer expires on September 30. On October 1, only full-price registration will be available until the final registration day, November 1.\n\n# Feedback\n\nThank you for participating in my Writing Great Grants course. Please take a moment to tell me about your experience by filling out the form below.\n\n# Name:\n\nNatalie Ballard\n\n# Location:\n\nWinnipeg\n\n# Comment:\n\nRelatively short compared to other writing courses I\u2019ve taken, Writing Great Grants provided a decent overview. I was impressed to learn that the instructor helped companies get millions of dollars in grants during her career, and I\u2019m glad to now have her as a resource if I ever get hired as a grant writer. Fortunately, I registered with Ben\u2019s Burst\u2019s code. Otherwise, I\u2019d have considered the tuition too high. The Web site gave me the impression that Ms. Gilliam would include more specifics about the actual writing process than she did.\n\n# Feedback\n\nThank you for participating in my Writing Great Grants course. Please take a moment to tell me about your experience by filling out the form below.\n\n# Participant Information\n\nName: Paul Voigt\n\nLocation: Toronto\n\n# Comment\n\nThis was a great course overall. The instructor shared a wealth of valuable insights, including her experiences as the founder of Orden International. I never realized that grant-writing firms even existed! I might start one of my own if I ever leave my current grant-writing job. The course focused mainly on researching grant opportunities and analyzing samples tips during successful grant applications. Gilliam simply referred us to other resources. The course description on her Web site was a bit misleading in that regard.\n\n"

The project will add a center turn lane, bicycle paths, pedestrian paths, and streetlights. In addition, a side gutter will be added to improve water flow.\n\nThe Parsons Road project ties into work completed between Hallam Road and Ingraham Avenue earlier this year. This work will improve access to your businesses and increase pedestrian safety on Parsons Road, which can be quite busy. The roadwork is expected to take three months to complete. Please visit www.yorkcity.gov/parsonsroadproject for more information.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlfredo Moreno\n\nCommunity Relations Manager\n\nBethany Construction and Engineering\n\n"

Park officials are the only ones who should be stacking rocks, and they do so strategically on trails where the path may be unclear. If you see rocks that have been stacked, please leave them alone, and do not create confusion by making your own stack.\n\n"

The statement issued on Tuesday reflected recent scrutiny over whether the company is justified in claiming that its tea leaves are grown without the use of pesticides. The issue has since attracted national attention.\n\n\u201cWe procure tea leaves only from producers who meet our strict quality standards. We never settle for anything less,\u201d said Orinti CEO Giovanni Shaw in a public statement.\n\n"

Each shipment will contain a variety of individually packaged items in attractive and reusable containers. Accompanying every shipment will be an itemised receipt listing product numbers. Please refer to these numbers when contacting us with questions about a product.\n\nEverything from vitamins to lotions to cosmetics will be chosen just for you based on the eight answers you provided in the personal-preferences questionnaire. Every item you receive is guaranteed for one full year from the date of shipment. If you wish to return an item, simply send us the unused portion along with a short note describing the reason for your dissatisfaction. Upon receipt, we will send you an alternative of equal value.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAnita Ngubane\n\nMember Services Specialist, Club Freshen-Up\n\n"

Your contributions to Allegrino Travel Agency helped place our company on the radar this year: Due to your relentless work; your direction of the \"Find a New Way\" marketing initiative, and your strategic development and placement of advertising, our travel agency is now one of the most recognized brands in Europe.\n\nThe award ceremony will be held at the next shareholders' meeting of Allegrino Travel Agency in Copenhagen on 19 November. I would like to ask you to consider being a featured speaker at the meeting in addition to accepting your award. I believe your insights into boosting market share and finding new ways to reframe our services would be incredibly valuable for shareholders and other employees to hear. Of course, all the expenses associated with your travel to Copenhagen would be covered by the company. Please let me know whether you will be available to accept your award and speak about your recent initiatives.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNoor Darwish\n\nCEO\n\nAllegrino Travel Agency\n\n"

You did some work in her home yesterday. I was wondering if you would be able to move a power outlet in my house.\n\nMatt Clayton (9:55 A.M): We can help with that. Where is the outlet? By the way, I\u2019m adding my business partner, Denise Bosworth, to this message.\n\nVincent Benedict (9:57 A.M): It's in my living room, near the floor. I want to move it up. I am going to have a television screen mounted on my wall, and it will look ugly if there are cords hanging down to the outlet.\n\nMatt Clayton (10:00 A.M): OK. We can do this type of work for you.\n\nVincent Benedict (10:02 A.M): How much would something like that cost?\n\nMatt Clayton (10:03 A.M): That will probably be between one and two hours of labor. We charge $50 per hour.\n\nDenise Bosworth (10:05 A.M): However, we might find pipes, insulation, or other wiring in the wall once we open it.\n\nVincent Benedict (10:08 A.M): I understand. Thank you for the information. Are you available to come out and see what needs to be done?\n\nMatt Clayton (10:12 A.M): I will have someone from our office get in touch with you by phone to schedule a visit.\n\n"

        "Content": "# In the Kitchen\n\n# Reviewed by Peter Gottlieb\n\nQi Chien understands how restaurants work. Her new book, In the Kitchen: How to Thrive in the Restaurant Business, expertly advises restaurant managers on handling picky diners. Throughout the book, Chien offers concise, practical suggestions with easy-to-understand concepts. Overall, the book offers a colorful snapshot of the challenges in the industry, from creating reasonable schedules for chefs to appeasing various tasks involved in the day-to-day operations of a restaurant.\n\nChien\u2019s book is unique among other industry guides in that she interviewed restaurant owners, managers, and customers as part of her research. She even spoke to journalists who write restaurant reviews to get a good sense of what they most prize in a dining experience. My only criticism is that the book should have also included the perspective of chefs, especially since their role is crucial to a restaurant\u2019s success. This caveat aside, In the Kitchen is an insightful and instructive read.\n\nTo: editor@lakecountyherald.com\n\nFrom: qichien@rapidonline.com\n\nDate: August 5\n\nSubject: In the Kitchen\n\n# To the Editor:\n\nDate: August 5\n\nNewspaper:\n\nI have appreciated his thoughtful comments about my works over the years, delighted to read Peter Gottlieb's review of my latest book, In the Kitchen, in your newspaper. I was especially glad that he liked the chapter about restaurant reviewers, since initially I had been reluctant to interview the journalists for the book. It is true that I could have included a greater variety of insights, but unfortunately the people whose views he most wanted to hear were just too busy to speak with me before the publishing deadline. Perhaps this is something I can address in an updated edition of the book.\n\nQi Chien\n\n"

Here are some general instructions to start.\n\nOn the back wall, hang the Vint Apparel neon sign high enough to be seen over other furniture in the store. The sign has already shipped and should be delivered next Monday. There should be four\u2014two for each of the side walls. The racks and shelving to display clothing are already there; please place the three circular racks in the center of the store and put the two shelving units along the left side as you enter the store. Finally, place the cashier station to the right as you enter the store.\n\nHarriet, I have attached a drawing of the layout that includes more detail.\n\nRegards,\nKarl Vinton, Owner\n\nHarriet Trimble [8:05 AM:]\n\neverything in place by June 15 because the grand opening is fast approaching: Mr. Vinton stressed that they need to start stocking merchandise the week of June 20 to be ready for the official event on July 1.\n\nJackson Ortega [8:06 A.M:]\n\nWe can do that.\n\nHarriet Trimble [8:07 A.M:]\n\nAlso, there has been a change to the layout drawing: Now we are to install a mannequin display where the two shelving units were and then move the shelving units to the side walls. I will bring an updated copy for you when I come over this afternoon.\n\n"

If you agree that this meets your needs, I can send a contract.\n\nI should point out that your corporate headquarters in Beeman Square is next to apartments owned by Foursquare. One apartment here will also become available in August. This would be very convenient if you have short-term visitors.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSam Flannery\n\nLeasing Agent\n\n"

As you know, Deonardo was developed to allow you, our nursing staff, more time to focus on patients. This is exciting work.\n\nIt has been a month, and Cybernetic Robotics would like to hear about your experiences with Deonardo. Please use the following link to complete an online survey: The team especially wants to know about your experiences with Deonardo during the state reviewers' inspection on January 28. At the end of the survey, you may leave any additional comments you have about the robot.\n\nwww.cyberneticrobotics.com/survey/everlast/\n\nBest regards,\n\nGretchen Robertson\n\nDirector, Everlast Hospital\n\nhttps://www.cyberneticrobotics.com/survey/everlast/01282\n\nDeonardo is easy to work with. I like that I don't have to tell Deonardo directly what to do. When I update patient information in our system, Deonardo's tasks are updated as well. I have been better able to concentrate on my patients because I know Deonardo takes care of little things that used to take up so much of my time.\n\nDeonardo was particularly helpful during a recent state review because it delivered patients\u2019 medications for all the nurses so that we didn't have to focus on patient care. I believe Deonardo helped us receive positive comments from the inspectors.\n\nI do wish Deonardo could respond to voice commands. And occasionally, its wheels squeak as it moves around. But patients like watching it work, and everyone wants to take pictures with it. I wonder if you could get Deonardo to stand still for pictures?\n\nLan Duy, BSN\n\nTo: Everlast Hospital Nursing Staff\n\nFrom: Gretchen Robertson\n\nDate: February 13\n\nSubject: Deonardo in-house pilot\n\nThank you all for your help with Deonardo, our nursing robot: I\u2019m glad that our staff has been able to take part in such groundbreaking work.\n\nThose of you who work directly with Deonardo can expect it to behave a bit differently in the coming week. It will be programmed to perform some new tasks. Previously, it waited at the nurse's station between tasks. Now, it will spend some of this time interacting with patients who may want to pose for pictures with it. When Deonardo is in this socializing mode, the eyes on its LED face will be heart-shaped instead of the round eyes that indicate that it is in work mode.\n\nFinally, the hospital will be purchasing two additional robots in the next few months to work in other areas of the hospital. I appreciate your willingness to work with this new technology. We look forward to learning how robots can further improve employee and patient experiences.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGretchen Robertson\nDirector, Everlast Hospital\n\n"

Given the key selection criteria the suitable candidate must meet\u2014a demonstrated ability to improve product offerings, a keen awareness of consumers\u2019 tastes, and in-depth knowledge of nutritional science\u2014we have narrowed the applicant pool to Alex Mooring and Inez Fuentes. While either makes for an excellent choice, I believe that Ms. Fuentes is better suited to the role. Though somewhat less experienced than Mr. Mooring, she has innovative ideas that are in line with our company\u2019s needs.\n\nAttached are the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and references of the two candidates. The dates, times, and location of their final interviews will be forthcoming in another e-mail when that information is finalized.

Upon graduation, she accepted a two-year internship at Italy's prestigious Rome Institute of Culinary Arts.

The system promises to delight the senses, not only through vivid visuals but also through superb, lifelike sound projected to the listeners from all sides.\n\nSingle-ticket prices for adults and special rates for youngsters, families, and school groups will be announced soon. The anticipated public debut for the programme is 1 July.\n\n"

Rapido joins Gamma Air and Southern Skylines in serving the regional airport.\n\n\u201cRapido Airline was our top choice as an expansion airline,\u201d said Encino Pass Mayor Chris Donovan. \u201cIt is known for offering low fares, maintaining on-time schedules, and surpassing safety inspections. We\u2019re pleased that it has decided to join us here in Encino Pass.\u201d\n\nAs the city of Encino Pass has grown in recent years, Encino Pass Airport has seen increased air traffic, despite being the smallest airport in the state. With flights to Encino Pass regularly booked to capacity, travelers often had to use other regional airports. The Encino Pass Airport and the city council have both been working to attract more airlines to the area to better accommodate the increase in the number of travelers.\n\nThe city and airport are also in talks to provide shuttle bus service between the airport and surrounding parking facilities, refurbish the rental car booths, and add another terminal to the airport. These negotiations are part of the city\u2019s long-term plan to increase tourism in the area.\n\nRapido Airline\u2019s flights between Encino Pass and Summerset begin on July 9, with more routes to be added later in the month.\n\n"

College Station (May 15)\u2014On June 2, Yum and Walk Food Tours will add a culinary destination for College Station to its statewide list of destinations. The local itinerary includes five stops in a three-hour time span\u2014Giuseppina\u2019s Trattoria, Yucatan Plate, Kerala Kebabs, Spice Rub Stop, and Delicious Doughnuts.\n\n\u201cCollege Station has been overlooked as a culinary destination for too long,\u201d said tour-company owner Ed Lopez, a former chef; Lopez also once worked as a journalist and wrote about cuisine for the Beacon. Local officials are excited about the tour company\u2019s move into the area; College Station Mayor Maria Garcia said, \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have Yum and Walk Food Tours add us to their list of destinations.\u201d\n\nYum and Walk Food Tours brings visitors to restaurants, bakeries, and specialty stores to sample both sweet and savory treats. Visitors walk through the city with an experienced guide, who also shares information about each neighborhood\u2019s history. Mr. Lopez himself will serve as the tour guide in College Station, his home, until September 3. Customers can schedule private tours if they have any specific dietary preferences.\n\nTickets are $50 each. The ten-week touring season begins on July 2 and lasts until September 3. Tours take place on Sundays from 1 PM to 4 PM.\n\n"

We encourage everyone to interact with the visitors while they are here.\n\nThe executives in the group are leaders in the field of electronics development and manufacturing:\n\n- Dr. Sung-Hye Kim leads Research and Development. Her individual contributions have focused on how magnetic fields influence the efficiency of components within electrical devices. Dr. Kim's work is influential throughout the international electronics industry.\n- Jin-Woong Lee, chief production officer at Seongnam Electronics, heads the team that designed the manufacturing processes at the plant near Seoul. The award-winning techniques developed by Mr. Lee assure both cost-effectiveness and quality.\n\nOn the afternoon of November 10, we will hold a reception in the conference room to welcome our guests. Specifics will be sent to the entire staff in an e-mail. Please plan on attending. Contact Mr. Stewart Lark, who is serving as the event's coordinator, and me with any questions you may have.\n\nThank you;\n\nJanice Capaldi, Director of Operations, Dolesley Electronics, Inc.\n\n"

I just learned from one of our managers that you offer this course book in languages other than English. May I send back twenty of the English language versions and get ten Polish and ten Portuguese books instead? Some of our new employees said they would really appreciate being able to read the crucial information in their first language.\n\nThe books I wish to return are still in their original packaging. I can have them boxed and shipped quickly, but I will wait for your acknowledgement and instructions regarding paperwork.\n\nSincerely,\n\nElla Feehan\n\nFood Services Director\n\nRossfield Hotels Ltd.\n\n# Parleganis Publishing\n\n# Returns and Exchanges Policy\n\nWe accept products under the following conditions:\n\n- Unmarked, unused materials may be returned or exchanged within 90 days of purchase.\n- Items returned or exchanged more than 30 days after purchase are subject to a restocking fee equal to 20% of the cover price.\n- Individual paperback books will receive partial credit:\n- - Paperback books come in plastic-wrapped bundles of ten.

        "Content": "# Review: Pizza in Bobbingworth\n\nSubmitted by: Gerard Landis\n\nThere is a new pizza restaurant in town called Maple Pizza House. Not to my surprise, it offers a number of signature pizzas with maple flavoring, including dessert pizzas.\n\nWhile I personally did not like the maple-flavored pizza at all, the rest of my party enjoyed a large maple-ham pizza as a main course. The others in my group also devoured the maple-walnut dessert pizza, which, to me, tasted like an overly sweet, sticky pie.\n\nFortunately for me, the menu includes some pizzas that do not have maple flavoring: I ordered a traditional cheese pizza. It was served piping hot and was delicious.\n\nBecause there were tasty menu options that pleased everyone, I rate the Maple Pizza House 4 stars out of 5, and I would recommend visiting.\n\n# Maple Pizza House\n\n83 Fox Lane, Bobbingworth, CM2 9B0\n\nTel: 077 5014 0314\n\n# Signature Maple Pizzas (with red sauce)\n\n|Personal|Large|\n|---|---|\n|Chicken maple|\u00a34.5|\n|Maple ham|\u00a35|\n|Pineapple|\u00a34|\n\n# Traditional Pizzas (select red or white sauce)\n\n|Cheese|\u00a34|\u00a313|\n|---|---|---|\n|Vegetable|\u00a34|\u00a313|\n|Meatball|\u00a34|\u00a313|\n\n# Dessert Pizzas (with brown butter sauce)\n\n|Cinnamon maple| |\u00a35|\u00a317|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Maple walnut| | |\u00a311|\n|Pineapple|\u00a311| | |\n\n# ALL BEVERAGES:\n\n\u00a32\n\n"

I have been unable to find this part, so a friend who found a new steering wheel through your company recommended that I contact you. I was wondering how much you would charge for locating a vintage British car part like this. Also, I noticed that Germany is not listed on your website as a shipping destination. Do you ever ship to areas other than the countries that are currently listed there? Thanks for your help! Working on this car has been a great experience, but I\u2019m eager to get this thing on the road!\n\nTo: Gerald Aldegunde &lt;carmanga55@saffronmail.de&gt;\n\nFrom: Bethany Turnhout &lt;bturnhout@northamcarparts.co.uk&gt;\n\nDate: 28 August\n\nSubject: Shipping notification\n\nDear Mr. Aldegunde,\n\nYour item will arrive on 30 August no later than 8:00 PM at the following address:\n\nKanalstrasse 60, 01067 Dresden, Germany.

The company, founded by real estate agents Rayna Wong and Derrick Lim, specializes in converting industrial buildings into apartment complexes.\n\n\u201cTurning commercial buildings into residential spaces has its challenges,\u201d Ms. Wong said. \u201cHowever, we are committed to repurposing buildings instead of constructing new ones.\u201d\n\nThis commitment was recently cited in a speech by Yamina Badawi, Singapore's minister of Housing and Urban Development, who applauded RHC\u2019s contribution to the nation\u2019s housing supply:\n\nRHC completed its first conversion project four years ago\u2014the Kallang Overlook apartment complex. Since then, RHC has completed five more projects: Asten Estates, Tampines Tower, Lakeside Manor, Yishun Terrace, and now Bay Commons.\n\n\u201cBay Commons represents a departure from our previous projects,\u201d Ms. Wong noted. \u201cThis housing complex is designed primarily for students at the nearby Changi Technological Institute.\u201d Units at Bay Commons are now available for rent or purchase, she added.\n\n# Current Listings\n\nRayder Holdings Corporation turns vacant commercial properties into pleasant residential buildings. Below are our current offerings in alphabetical order:\n\n|Asten Estates:|14-unit building with pool, fitness centre, and car park|\n|---|---|\n|Bay Commons:|60 studio apartments with shared kitchen areas and other common rooms|\n|Kallang Overlook:|40-unit apartment complex situated on the Kallang River|\n|Lakeside Manor:|28-unit building with indoor pool, outdoor tennis and basketball courts, playground, and on-site cafeteria|\n|Tampines Tower:|36-unit apartment complex with pool and fitness room|\n|Yishun Terrace:|55-unit apartment complex with outdoor sports facilities (tennis, basketball, football), indoor swimming pool, catch-and-release fishing pond, and picnic area|\n\nFor details and other queries, contact info@rayderholdingscorporation.com.sg.\n\nToday 9:53 A.M.\n\nHello, Mr. Goh.

She has some excellent ideas about design and content for our Web site. The new site she created will help us attract new clients and help our current clients get the information they need. In addition to the minor changes you suggested earlier, we could have a blog on the Web site to post accounting tips and share some anecdotes. We need to sit down with Carol to share our thoughts. Her schedule is open tomorrow morning\u2014will you be free?\n\nSincerely,\nMilo\n\n"

        "Content": "# Driverless Buses in Swansea?\n\nSWANSEA (12 May) - A consortium of city government officials and local leaders is considering driverless buses for some city routes. Commissioned with exploring options to improve transportation in Swansea and surrounding areas, the group recently sent three members on a trip to Malaga, Spain, where they learned about an eight-kilometre loop of driverless buses.\n\nAnisha Deepak, an engineer specialising in transportation innovation, served as a technical consultant on the trip. She was impressed by the complexity of the artificial intelligence system, which allows the buses to learn as they collect data on every day: what they learned; despite concerns about safety and traffic regulations, Consortium member Gareth Elias was also impressed by what he learned.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence makes these buses very safe in real-world situations,\u201d she said. \u201cNevertheless, it\u2019s best to have a human operator on board at all times in case of emergencies.\u201d\n\nA public community forum is scheduled for 2 June to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of driverless buses. Mr. Elias could see driverless buses becoming a reality before long, but only in specific cases. \u201cI believe they would be particularly useful during festivals and special events,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine them being on the roads every day.\u201d\n\nVisit the Swansea Town Council\u2019s website at www.swanseatowncouncil.gov.uk to learn more.\n\n"

How things have changed! This week, the business won a contract to supply a regional food distributor here in Eastern Australia. This achievement certainly would not have been possible without you. You have all worked hard to keep pace with such tremendous growth, and it was not always easy. To show my appreciation, I have decided that each of you will receive a bonus.\n\nThe future looks bright: With our solid team and our streamlined production process, I am optimistic that we will see our product placed on even more supermarket shelves soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nValentina Rosetti\n\nChief Executive Officer, Rosetti Pasta Company Ltd.\n\n"

We received your request this morning for assistance in acquiring a new physical badge. To receive a replacement, visit the corporate security office in Paulsen Hall between 7 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. You will be required to show a form of government-issued identification.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take advantage of a new corporate initiative. The company app installed on all employees' mobile devices now includes a digital identification card that can be used to gain entry to the corporate parking garage and campus buildings. To access the digital ID card in the app, look for the \"ID Card\" tab. You can then scan your digital ID to enter all secure areas.\n\nIf you have questions or need additional help, please call corporate security at 863-555-0171.\n\nThank you,\n\nHopper Technology Corporate Security\n\n"

Where are we with the schedule for the weekly New Assets lunch series for our new hires?\n\nStephan Ruess [9:18 A.M:] We've finalized the session topics. I believe we have confirmed one speaker:\n\nMargo Basset [9:24 A.M] Fantastic. Is she able to present on June 10 as we planned?\n\nAlban Mithat [9:20 A.M:] That is correct: Salima Abubakar from our north suburban office.\n\nAlban Mithat [9:26 A.M:] She is, and she suggested that a panel discussion might be more engaging for her topic, renewable resources. She will moderate the discussion: I've e-mailed the three employees she suggested as panelists.\n\nMargo Basset [9:27 A.M:] That sounds good. And the other sessions?\n\nStephan Ruess [9:28 A.M:] So, the topics for the other six sessions will be cryptocurrencies, commodities, investments, start-ups, real estate, and virtual interfaces. I hope to have speakers for those sessions lined up by the end of this week.\n\nMargo Basset [9:31 A.M:] And they'll all be held at the midtown office.\n\nStephan Ruess [9:32 A.M:] Correct. Four of our seven new hires are permanently assigned to the midtown office. The other new hires will be there on session days for required training.\n\n"

The handbook was written specifically for the Galway Department of Transportation.\n\nDuring their three-year study, the team was tasked with researching ways to improve plantings along roadways. Each chapter explores one of the ten best practices identified by the team; they said recommendations can be applied by municipal agencies throughout the country.\n\nMs. Urban said, \u201cThese basic techniques are relevant regardless of where they are implemented. The only site-specific variable is plant selection, as that will depend upon the particular geographic region.\u201d\n\nAnother point conveyed by the study is that successful plant establishment requires an integrated approach: improving roadside tree planting requires a thorough assessment of a site\u2019s existing conditions as well as a wide variety of management practices to address the specific issues involved.\n\nThe final results of the government-sponsored research project were compiled into a 50-page handbook. Although the soil can\u2019t absorb water or nutrients well, which makes it difficult for new growth to establish itself.\n\n"

We have received reports of units overheating and becoming unusable. To address this issue, an additional fan needs to be installed in your computer. Please return the gaming system to the store in which it was purchased, using your personal customer identification number: PCI-70734. Your system will then be sent back to the manufacturer and repaired at no expense to you.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKobu Matsui\n\nVice President\n\nChisaka Gaming Systems\n\nTo: Virginia Granger &lt;Vgranger@chisakagamingsystems.jp&gt;\n\nFrom: Jennifer Kinkaid &lt;jkinkaid@albancgm.com&gt;\n\nDate: June 12\n\nSubject: Product recall\n\nDear Ms. Granger;\n\nOur retail stores have been accepting your CGS-P27 High-Speed Gaming Computers for repairs. As you may know, owners of your gaming system are reluctant to give up their devices for repair once they find that they will be without the system for two to three weeks. Today alone, three customers (PCI-70734, PCI-17503, and PCI-90022) declined to have their systems repaired.\n\nThe good news is that users of your gaming system are very loyal. However, to increase compliance with the recall and as a public relations gesture, you could provide us with several devices as part of a loaner program. Let me know how I can assist with this arrangement.\n\nThank you!\n\nJennifer Kinkaid\n\nAlban Computers, Games, and More\n\n"

To that end, we will conduct a survey during the month of April.\n\nGiven your expertise in survey design and analysis, I would like you to develop a customer satisfaction survey that includes an evaluation of the digital marketing services we advertise on our Web site. It will be sent to each of our longtime clients here in Kenya.\n\nPlease have a draft ready by 17 February and distribute it to the members of the management team for their review. You and I will present the draft at the management team\u2019s meeting on 23 February at 2:00 PM.\n\nRegards,\n\nHenry Bunyasi\n\n# Services Satisfaction Survey\n\nAt The Ushindi Group, we strive to provide you with top-quality marketing services. That is why we are asking our longtime clients to complete this short survey about our digital marketing services. With the information you provide, we can identify areas for improvement. Please submit your responses on or before 19 May. Thank you for helping us to serve you better.\n\n# Please type one of the following values into the appropriate box for each service:\n\n|Value|Description|\n|---|---|\n|1|very dissatisfied|\n|2|dissatisfied|\n|3|no opinion|\n|4|satisfied|\n|5|very satisfied|\n\n# Digital Marketing Services\n\n1. A. Advertising on social media\n2. B. Content creation; including written content, photos, and videos\n3. C. E-mail marketing to existing and potential customers\n4. D. Web and mobile app development and design\n\n# Client name (optional):\n\n# Company News\n\n# Improvements to Our Services\n\nIn response to customer feedback, The Ushindi Group will introduce a new e-mail marketing strategy on 15 July. Our new focus will be on triggered e-mails. Triggered e-mails are sent out automatically based on customer behaviour and have a much higher response rate than traditional marketing e-mails. Triggered e-mails help companies turn casual buyers into loyal customers.\n\nWe anticipate that this change will result in a noticeable increase in repeat customers for our clients. The price of our services will remain the same. For more information, you may contact your marketing account manager directly, call The Ushindi Group at 0800 205 555, or send an e-mail to info@theushindigroup.co.ke.\n\n"

Whether you are a longtime fan or have never seen a Rubio film, you will surely enjoy this offering at Merrington Cinema.\n\nHis extensive familiarity with a range of genres is apparent in his work. Titles range from the romantic Send Me Some Roses to the horror classic That House.\n\n# Choose Your Own Double Feature\n\nIn August, we will celebrate the acclaimed director Pedro Rubio's birthday by showing many of his movies. And you can purchase tickets to two movies for the price of one! Rubio made the films listed below at the beginning of his directing career: See the Schedule page for the complete list of films and their weekly viewing times.\n\n|Put a Roof on It|Comedy|102 minutes|\n|---|---|---|\n|Through a Diamond Rain|Science Fiction|124 minutes|\n|Weekends and Memories|Drama|115 minutes|\n|The Strange Drive|Western|107 minutes|\n\nConstruction workers do their best to build a wealthy man's dream home while his brother tries to take over the project.\n\nTwo teams of researchers travel to Neptune and try to send their findings back to Earth.\n\nA group of old friends gather at a country house and discover that much has changed since they were last together. This film won the Gold Dreamer Award.\n\nCowboys on a cattle drive encounter a series of interesting and unusual strangers.\n\n# Merrington Cinema Reviews\n\nRecently, I read a great article about director Pedro Rubio. It contained a lot of information about his work and life, including some surprising information about what he has been doing since he retired from filmmaking. The article also mentioned that Merrington Cinema would be showing his films. So, I went to the cinema's website and saw the two-for-one deal: I thought this would be an excellent way to spend a Saturday, so I went! I saw two wonderful movies. One of the films I saw was new to me: it was about scientists on a mission in space. I loved it!\n\nFor a movie fan like me, Merrington Cinema's promotion was perfect. I understand there will be a similar promotion for Meredeth Bui's films in October. I'll be sure to take advantage of great offers like this again.\n\n\u2014Talia Pak\n\n"

I particularly enjoy your Nonfiction Corner; one of my favorites was \"Waygone Beach,\" which inspired me to write \"Ji's Journey.\" I believe it would be an ideal fit for this section. Like \"Waygone Beach,\" \"Ji's Journey\" is a true story of hope and perseverance.\n\nThank you for your consideration and for creating a forum for new writers like me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLen Sutherland\n\nTo: len sutherland @ onyxmail.com\n\nFrom: jerrybuckman @undeniable.com\n\nDate: July 2\n\nSubject: Your submission\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland,\n\nYour story, \"Ji's Journey,\" generated a great deal of positive feedback about the June issue. Congratulations! And your instincts were correct regarding your story's placement. All this has us hoping you will submit more stories to Undeniable. As an added incentive, we will be increasing our honorarium to $100 beginning next month.\n\nAs a subscriber, you are likely familiar with Stacy Jordan's question-and-answer column featuring a different writer each month. Would you be willing to answer a few questions about your literary training, writing method, and how you find story ideas? If so, I will forward your e-mail address to Ms. Jordan, who will reach out to you in the near future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJerry Buckman\nAssociate Editor\n\n"

We expect a new shipment within three to four weeks. However, if you prefer not to wait, Home Things will be glad to ship the Home Extreme2 lint roller to you at no extra charge. The Extreme2 model includes a perforated sticky tape for ease of use and comes with two refills. Like the Performa model, it has a strong adhesive that effectively removes hair, fuzz, lint, and dust from most fabrics.\n\nYou can request this similar product to be shipped to you in place of the one you ordered, as long as you make the change to your order before the original item ships. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGlen McCraine\n\nCustomer Service Specialist\n\nHome Things\n\n"

The change in retirement benefits will be applied for all full-time employees here at Blanen Industries. Instead, their retirement funds will be provided in the form of company stock to be deposited in their retirement portfolios.\n\nOur current retirement management firm, Proxave Futures, has been informed of this change in retirement benefits. The firm will manage the transition and will continue to provide customer support to Blanen Industries employees. Questions should be directed to Pierre Dehaene at Proxave Futures rather than our human resources department.\n\nPlease work with Yua Suzuki, head of human resources, to provide her with the information she should include in her all-staff communication about this important change in employee benefits. Our president notified me that he would like to receive all reports related to this transition. Also, please continue to send me daily financial reports.\n\nBest,\n\nShamonica Walker, CFO\n\nBlanen Industries\n\n"

The total cost for conference events there would be \u20ac31,500. Individual hotel rooms would cost \u20ac80 per night for participants. In the event that attendance is high, we could also house participants in the nearby Hotel Milvio at \u20ac120 per night.\n\nI also looked into hotels in Genoa and Florence, but I could not find any that would be much cheaper in overall conference costs. More importantly, I am concerned that the greater cost of flights to those smaller cities could discourage some attendees. Rome, on the other hand, has affordable direct flights from most European cities. It will also be more affordable for our colleagues coming from Buenos Aires.\n\nIf you would like to pursue the Hotel al Ponte option, I will provide a detailed write-up of the anticipated costs and of the amenities offered by the hotel.\n\nBest,\n\nLuciano Moretti\n\nSecretary, International Technological Society\n\n"

It's often difficult to know whether the advice you encounter is based on scientific evidence. That's why the Central University Health Newsletter is indispensable. Each month, it delivers informative, easy-to-understand articles that summarize findings by researchers at the Central University School of Nutrition. For example, last April's issue evaluated nutritional supplements that are sold in supermarkets. The back page features our Ask an Expert column, in which the director of the School of Nutrition answers readers' questions.\n\nA one-year subscription is $20 and includes online access to all previous issues. We also offer a 10 percent discount on your first subscription renewal. What's more, subscribers receive our free weekly \"Healthy Living\" e-mail update, which includes special reports plus links to videos and podcasts.\n\nTo get started, simply go to our Subscribe page and follow the instructions.\n\n# Central University Health Newsletter\n\nReviewed by: Ari Kipp\n\nDate posted: August 4\n\nThis is my second year subscribing to the Central University Health Newsletter, which I read cover to cover. I'm particularly impressed with the Ask an Expert column, and always learn something new. This month, for instance, Dr. Stella Booth gives a surprising answer to the question of which pasta is most nutritious. I didn\u2019t know that bean-based pasta existed, much less how much fiber it contains. I tried it and will never go back to regular pasta. My sole complaint is that the newsletter is only twelve pages long!\n\n"

I want to commend you on your superb start as one of our independent freelance editors. Our clients had nothing but positive things to say about your work. As you know, we do not dictate how you structure your workday; instead, Brit-Revision (BRV) guidelines require simply that deadlines be met and that work quality be maintained. You have done both admirably.\n\nAs for the work that you did for our long-standing corporate client Lydia Quinn, you will see on your receipt that we have paid you at a higher hourly rate. Also, we will pay you for an additional 30 minutes of work that you did for Mr. Kent. He reported that you did consulting work for him over the phone on a short oral presentation that he created.\n\nI have initiated the transfer of \u00a3750 into your Stashcash account. The funds should appear in your account by tomorrow morning.\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaudio\n\nAccounts Payable, Brit-Revision Editing Services\n\n"

I am trying to set up my Motman Motors portal account; but I seem to be having trouble with my employee ID number. Each time I put the information into the system, I get an error message. I might not have the right number. Can you please advise me on how to address this?\n\nI also have another question. Will the orientation include any information for newcomers to San Antonio? I am excited to start exploring everything this great city offers.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to meeting you tomorrow in room 215 in the Pimzler Building.\n\nThank you,\n\nKaruna Dimaano\n\n"

I think that the video looks great so far; it clearly demonstrates why the Fluorolook is the best medical imaging device available. I have just a few notes before you proceed to create the final version:\n\n- At 20 seconds: Could you insert a short timeline of the history of The Hospital Equipment Company? I have attached the relevant information to this e-mail.\n- At 1 minute: Could you please replace the details of the control panel in this scene with a close-up shot?\n- At 2 minutes: The sequence in which the medical technician positions the patient and adjusts the machine moves too quickly. Can this be slowed down?\n\nI look forward to seeing the final version on September 23. As always, thank you and your colleagues at Video Genie Productions for the excellent work.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMs. Sapna Mathai, Project Manager\nThe Hospital Equipment Company\n\n# The Hospital Equipment Company\n\n# Invoice 9984\n\nBilling date: October 25\n\nInstallation date: October 26\n\n# Bill to:\n\nAll-City Hospital\n\n3 Shoreline Road\n\nClear Lake, Minnesota 55319\n\n|Quantity|Item Number|Description|Unit Price|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|2|62630|Fluorolook Imager|$242,300|$484,600|\n| | |Delivery and Installation|$2,350| |\n|Total|Total|Total|Total|$486,950|\n\n# MEMO\n\nFrom: All The Hospital Equipment Company Employees\n\nTo: Marcia Oliver; Vice President of Sales\n\nDate: October 27\n\nRe: Good work!\n\nCongratulations on the successful launch of the Fluorolook Imager! The Hospital Equipment Company has made its first sale\u2014to a hospital in Clear Lake. And MDP Delivery has informed us that the two devices have been delivered.\n\nI would especially like to commend Ms. Mathai. She was instrumental in getting us to this point. The administrator of the hospital that made the purchase, Mr. Fabrice Lamontagne, credited his decision to the informational video. He remarked that the video effectively demonstrated why the Fluorolook Imager was the right device for his medical institution.\n\n"
